# RSSSTV

Rust SSTV protocol, DSP, template-rendering, and WAV integration components.

## Encode WAV

`encode-wav` renders a KDL template over a background image and writes a
complete SSTV transmission as streaming 48 kHz mono 16-bit PCM:

```text
cargo run -p encode-wav -- [--callsign CALLSIGN] <TEMPLATE.kdl> <BACKGROUND_IMAGE> <MODE> <OUTPUT.wav>
```

The callsign defaults to `N0CALL`, is uppercased, replaces `${mycall}` in the
template, and is sent as the trailing FSKID. The prepared background is also
available to `rximage` layers. Backgrounds are resized to cover the selected
mode and center-cropped. Template image assets are resolved relative to the
template file.

Supported transmit modes are Robot 36/72, Scottie 1/2/DX, Martin 1/2, and
PD50/90/120/160/180/240/290. Mode arguments ignore ASCII case, spaces, hyphens,
and underscores.

## Decode WAV

```text
cargo run -p decode-wav -- [--packet-size SAMPLES] <INPUT.wav> <OUTPUT_IMAGE>
```
